1. It will print "4". The value of i will be printed as it is a var and can be used anywhere in the function. The value of i will be 1 greater than the length of the prices array.
2. It will print "150". The value of the last discountedPrice calculated will be printed as it is var and can be used anywhere in the function.
3. It will print "150". The value of the last finalPrice calculated will be printed as it is var and can be used anywhere in the function.
4. The function will return [50, 100, 150]. The function takes the original array, and calculates the disounted prices based off the discount, and returns the discounted prices.

5. There will be an error. i uses let which means it can't be used outside the for loop.
6. There will be an error. discountedPrice uses let which means it can't be used outside the for loop.
7. It will print "150". The value of the last finalPrice calculated will be printed as it is let, but is declared before the for loop and therefore can be used anywhere in the function (after its declaration).
8. The function will return [50, 100, 150]. The function takes the original array, and calculates the disounted prices based off the discount, and returns the discounted prices.

9. There will be an error. i uses let which means it can't be used outside the for loop.
10. It will print 3. Length is declared as a const outside of the loop, which means it can be used anywhere after its declaration. The length of the array is printed.
11. The function will return [50, 100, 150]. The function takes the original array, and calculates the disounted prices based off the discount, and returns the discounted prices. The array is declared as const, which means you cannot assign it with new data. However, you can use push to manipulate the data, meaning the function will still work.

12.
